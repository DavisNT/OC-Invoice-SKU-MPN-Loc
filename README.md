OpenCart 2.3 Invoice SKU MPN Loc
===============
OpenCart 2.3 modification to display Manufacturer name, SKU, MPN and Location instead of Model in invoices (in OpenCart admin interface).

## Introduction

This modification changes invoices in OpenCart admin interface - adds Manufacturer, SKU, MPN and Location columns, and removes Model column from table of products in the invoice.

This is tested only on OpenCart 2.3.0.2.

## Installation

1. Open Extensions Installer in OpenCart admin interface.
1. Upload/install `Invoice-SKU-MPN-Loc.ocmod.xml`.
1. Open Modifications in OpenCart admin interface and click Refresh.
1. Edit the language file (e.g. `admin/language/en-gb/sale/order.php`) of your OpenCart installation (e.g. via FTP) and add (or adjust if needed) lines like these:

```php
$_['column_sku']             = 'SKU';
$_['column_mpn']             = 'MPN';
$_['column_manufacturer']    = 'Manufacturer';
$_['column_location']        = 'Location';
```
